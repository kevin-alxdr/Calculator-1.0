ABOUT
-------------------------------------------
This is my first attempt at making a Calculator in C#. I chose to do a make a calculator as a starting project, as I wanted to familiarise myself and practice 
with programming with C# syntax.


This version of my calulator is very basic and has many design flaws. Please refer to the 'README.txt' file in my other github project "Calculator 2.0" to see my thought
process.


NEW COMMANDS LEARNED DURING PROJECT
-------------------------------------------
* Console.WriteLine() - Writes a line of text to the console
* Console.ReadLine() - Allows user input to the console


IMPROVEMENTS TO BE MADE
-------------------------------------------
* I would like the calculator to be able to detect what kind of operation the user would like to do based on their input, rather than asking them
* I would like my files / code to be better organised and structured
* I would like to refactor my code to make it more efficient
